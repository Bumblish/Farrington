		<h3 id="about"> About </h3>
		<p id="lore"> Started in 1954 by our founder, Sir Fruitington III, the Fruit Fanatic was created to be a safe haven for all those seeking fruit related compadres. After being raided by the IRS in 2007 for tax evasion, the organization was forced to move its operations into the digital realm. Dispite the setbacks, the Fruit Fanatics are still the largest fruit loving conglmerate operating in the United States. With activity in all 50 states and several sitting members of the United States Congress, we will continue to fight for fruit and fruit lovers everywhere. See our membership page for information about the Fruit Fanatics. </p>
